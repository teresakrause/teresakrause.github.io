The Museum at the Schindler Factory
=========

The museum that now lives at the former administrative headquarters of Schindler's Factory is not dedicated to Schindler (whose story is told in the Film _Schindler's List_) -- it focuses on the second world war in Krakow and Poland.
We got off our bus and waited by the gates to the factory, and the wall of windows with photos of the men and women saved by Oskar Schindler.
