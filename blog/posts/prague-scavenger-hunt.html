We were luck enough to already have a picture the <em>astronomical clock</em> and <em>&quot;dancing house&quot;</em> from earlier tours, as well as the <em>Lennon wall</em> from an evening walk around the city yesterday.</p>
<p>The first location that the group visited was the graveyard near our hotel, where the Czech hero Jan Palach is buried. 
We had a hard time locating the grave, but after asking for directions several times we found the spot. 
The grave doesn&#39;t stick out from its neighbors -- it is quite plain and has no stone headstone, just photos and a paper sign placed on the stone.</p>
<p>Next we hopped on a train to old town, to grab a photo of the <em>grotto wall</em> in the Senate gardens. We found the wall quickly, then walked around the gardens, enjoying the statues and peacocks.</p>

<p>After the gardens and grotto wall, we walked to the <em>old Jewish cemetery</em>.
This cemetery happens to be the final resting place of Franz Kafka.
While some of the group went on a tour of the cemetery, I went ahead to the <em>statue of Franz Kafka</em>.
The surreal statue seemed a good fit for the author, whose books are very mind-bending.</p>

<p>After lunch, I met up with the rest of the group and we went to track down another Kafka statue: this time, just his head.
We had a lot of trouble finding the <em>Kafka head statue</em>. 
Despite having a photo to show, we couldn&#39;t find anyone off the street who had heard of it.
Finally, we realized that we had the spot marked wrong on the map, and found it a few blocks away.
The head was enourmous and hard to identify as a head at all from several angles.</p>
<p>Once we had finished off the assigned stops, we finished the afternoon with an hour paddle-boating on the Vltava river.</p></div></div></div></article><footer><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><p class="copyright"></p><p class="copyright text-muted">Copyright Â© Teresa Krause 2016</p></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
