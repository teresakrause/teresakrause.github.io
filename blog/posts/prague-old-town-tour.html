The bus dropped us near the Prague castle, whose courtyards we entered and admired.
We walked around the area and down the hill, looking out on a great view of the city.
From our vantage point we could see the &quot;Eiffel tower of Prague,&quot; the &quot;Ugliest building in Prague&quot; (also known as Jakeš&#39;s finger), and hundreds of church spires.</p>
<p>After we progressed down the hill, we waited by the Astronomical Clock until the hour mark when animatronics of the 12 apostles circled the window above the clock. A trumpet player also marked the hour, playing from a high window.</p>
<p>Some other places we drove past included the Spanish Synagogue, the Old New Synagogue, and the statue of Franz Kafka (who was born in Prague&#39;s Jewish Quarter.) 
The old border of the Jewish Ghetto was very obvious; on one side of the street were synagogues and buildings with hebrew characters -- on the other side, luxury shops.
This street apparently is a destination for those who don&#39;t mind the higher price tags in Central Europe.</p>
<p>The city of Prague has been very well preserved, even through the second world war. 
All of the historical buildings we passed in old town are originals, some dating back to medieval times.
The city is a UNESCO heritage site, and little has changed in the skyline in recent years.</p>
<p>As exhausted as I felt getting off the plane at the Prague airport, I&#39;m glad to have gotten to see the city right away. The city is extraordinarily beautiful, and I can&#39;t wait to see more of it.</p></div></div></div></article><footer><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><p class="copyright"></p><p class="copyright text-muted">Copyright © Teresa Krause 2016</p></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
